# Data_Analysis
Course work for STAT 359 Data Analysis

Course objectives and topics

Objectives: 
- To develop an understanding of techniques that are commonly used for statistical analysis from the perspective of application and examples.   
- To develop an ability to properly interpret statistical results.  
- To form a solid understanding of basic programming and data analysis in the R statistical software.  
- To understand some basic principles and techniques of machine learning and how they can be applied alongside statistical methods.  

Topics to be Covered:  
- Review of basic statistical concepts  
- linear regression and variable selection  
- contingency tables  
- nonlinear regression and generalized additive models  
- Poisson and binomialregression  
- Clustering dimension reduction  
- model selection including cross-validation  
- partial leastsquares and penalized regression  

Course was a projects based course where everything including exams, was done in Rstudio using R markdown.

Methods covered in each assignment  
Assignment 1:  
- Performed inferential statistics.  
- Designed boxplots and histograms.
- Grade recieved was 100%.  

Assignment 2: 
- Comparing different distibutions with histograms.  
- Testing for skewness and kurtosis in a population based on sample data using the bootstrap method.  
- Using the two sample T-test to test for equivalence in population means.  
- Grade recieved was 95%. (On question 3 forgot to use a qq-plot to check for normality)  

Assignment 3:  
- Equal variance testing.  
- Wilcox Ranked Sum test.  
- Graphical summaries such as bar-plots with error bars.  
- ANOVA test inorder to test if the means acorss multiple samples are equal.  
- qq-plots to judge the normality of the data.
- Grade recieved was 100%

Assignment 4:  
- Contigency tables.  
- Chi-squared test for association between variables.  
- Comparing observed and expected values.  
- Testing model fits.  
- Comparing 3 models for best fit.  
- Non-linear regression.  
- Grade recieved was 95%. (On question 2 I calculated the wrong chi-squared value. The correct value is 16.14)  

Assignment 5:  
- Linear regression analysis.  
- Model fitting and model comparissons between full and reduced models.  
- Model diagnostics checking with qq-plots, residual plots, and cooks distance plots.
- Data transformations as well as modle refitting.
- Interpretation of R-squared values.

Assignment 6:  
- Fitting linear models.
- Devaince test to determine variable significance to the model.
- Variable Confidence intervals.
- Goodness of fit test.
- Deviance residual plots.
